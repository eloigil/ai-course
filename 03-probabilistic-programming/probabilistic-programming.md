## Conditional probability
Conditional probability is a measure of the probability of an event occurring given that another event has (by assumption, presumption, assertion or evidence) occurred.

`P(A&B) = P(A) * P(B|A) + P(¬A) * P(B|¬A)`

### Bayes' theorem
Describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.
