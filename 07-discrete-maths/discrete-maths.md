# Discrete maths
## Graphs theory
**Nodes** conected with **edges** 
Types:
- simple: one edge between two nodes
- multigraph: more than one edge between two nodes
- pseudograph: edges to the same node
- ponderate: associates values to edges
- directed: edges have directionality
- directed multigraph: more than one edge with directionality between two nodes

**Degree of a vertex ($\delta$):** Number of edges converging in that node.

- **chain**: Association of nodes and edges
- **path**: A chain with no repetitions on edges or nodes
- **cycle**: Chain that ends at the same node it started without repeating other nodes.
- **closed chain**: Chain that ends at the same node it started repeating other nodes.

- **connected**: We can create a chain that connects all nodes.
- **non-connected**: We can't create a chain that connects all nodes.

#### Eulerian paths and eulerian cycles
- eulerian path: a path that travels through all edges just once.
- eulerian cycle: a path that travels through all edges once and ends at the same node it started.
All node degrees are even.

#### Hamiltonian paths and eulerian cycles
- hamiltonian path: a path that travels through all nodes just once.

$$
\delta(a)+\delta(b)\geq{n_{nodes}-1}
$$

*If it doesn't match this condition, it's not exclusive. It may be a hamiltonian pathe either.*

- hamiltonian cycle: a path that travels through all nodes once and ends at the same node it started.

If a node has $\delta = 1$ it can't be a hamiltonian cycle**


## Trees
- free: main node not clear
- rooted: root node
- expansion: each edge is ponderated
- binary: 2 connections in each level maximum
  - complete binary: each node has 0 or 2 sons
  - full binary: each leaf is in the same level
  - degenerated: most of the nodes have 1 son

**subtree**: nested tree

###Â Minimal expansion tree
Connecting all nodes at minimum cost

### Tree traveling
- pre-order: root-left-right
- in-order: left-root-right
- post-order: left-right-root


## Algorithms
### Prim's algorithm
Calculates minimal expansion tree.

1. start
2. select a random node
3. select the lowest value edge
4. iterate connecting the lowest edge to the connected nodes
5. it ends when all nodes are connected when $n-1$ edges
6. end

### Dijkstra's algorithm
Calculates minimal route to get a node B from A.

1. start
2. Assign an infinite distance to each non-visited node
3. Keep a list of all visited nodes
4. Calculate distances to each node using last distance
5. If the new distance is lower than the last one, replace it
6. it ends when it reaches the destination node
7. end

### Kruskal's algorithm
Calculates minimal expansion tree.

1. start
2. select the lowest value edge
3. In each iteration add the available edge with the lowest value.
4. it ends when all nodes are connected when $n-1$ edges
6. end

### Fleury's algorithm
Finds an eulerian cycle

1. start
2. verify the degree of the graph
3. In each iteration build a new closed path, visiting edges that hasn't been visited
4. replace each new path in the starting one until all edges have been visited
6. end

*each node has to be visitted half of each degree times at maximum, except for the starting node*

### Max flow algorithm
Finds a path with max flow that can be sent from A to B

1. start
2. direct flows and initiate in 0
3. get paths searching the greatest ponderation
4. choose lowest flow in trajectory
5. update the graph with minimum capacities
6. look for new increasing trajectories and repeat until exhaustion
7. end

*each node has to be visitted half of each degree times at maximum, except for the starting node*
