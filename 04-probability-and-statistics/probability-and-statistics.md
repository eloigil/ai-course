# Probability & statistics
## Probability
- **Sample space (Ω)**: Set of values we can get from a specific experiment.
- **Event**: Each result we get from an experiment that is in the sample space
  - possible: there is a possibility that it will happen
  - sure: only this event can happen
  - impossible: this event can't happen

### Laplace's rule
`P(A) = favorable cases of A / possible cases`

### Compound probability
More than one random event occurs.
#### Event types:
- compatible: when it can be found in each sample space
- incompatible: when it can't be found in each sample space
- complementary: when joining all events in a group, they conform the sample space

#### Union
Event formed with all elements that match A or B
`P(A∪B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A∩B)`

#### Intersection
Event formed with all elements that match A and B
`P(A∩B) = P(A|B) * P(B)`
`P(B|A) = P(A∩B) / P(A) si P(A)≠0`
